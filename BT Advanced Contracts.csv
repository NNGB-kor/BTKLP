<i><b>Greetin's Commander {Commander.LastName},

On occasion, in the course of doing business, I come privy to certain knowledge and opportunities. Opportunities which, me and mine bein' the well-known rabblerousers and buckleswashers we are, be not in a position to take advantage of. But you and yours, what with bein' all ""registered"" and ""licensed"" and ""whatnot"" with the veneer o' civilization an' legitimatism, could do. If'n yer interested, give us a nod or a wink an' we'll surely keep you apprised when choice chances do occur. Mind, if'n we come to ye with a job, ye best be takin' it or we'll find some other outfit fit for the task.
