It seems that the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSnordsIrregulars],Snord's Irregulars]] are selling off some material after their clash with Victor-aligned forces on Odessa. Included in the lot of material they're selling is a one-off FrankenMech made by one of their MechTechs, Shorty Sneede. Seems that Sneede met his end on Odessa and the unit is selling his 'Mech. I guess it used to be a Rifleman but is heavily modified now. I've got a contact with the Irregulars and could reach out if we're interested in buying the 'Mech? It's a little expensive and I have no idea what precisely we'll be getting but having a 'Mech from the very famous Irregulars has gotta look good to employers.""",

""So, if I've got this right, Johann's Jaegers are an elite mercenary unit and they're asking us for a training battle to keep their skills sharp? That about the shape of it?"" You nod affirmative and Darius's frown deepens. ""This is a weird situation, Commander.

Are we interested in the offer? Should I contact them back and accept?""


You muse on the idea for a moment, long enough for Yang to pipe up, ""I'd say yes, Commander!

The firm and commanding voice coming from beneath it asks his question again. ""Well, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, you've heard my offer. I join your crew and I bring my 'Mech, Akulakhan, with me.

She watches as you all glance at each other, seeming to take that as enough confirmation to carry on. ""[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Blue_Lore_Aether],Aether]], Mechwarrior, Arano Royal Guard.

Solaris VII, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]]: Tensions reached a boiling point as violence spilled into the streets of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolaris7],Solaris VII]] last month. What began as a Grand Championship match between Steiner favorite Michael Searcy and Davion star Victor Vandergriff turned into open warfare after a failure of the Solaris stadium containment field allowed the two fighters to break through the stadium walls and into the streets. Fans and nationals on both sides quickly took to arms, dividing the city into Lyran and [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],FedSuns]] districts. Only after the two champions met to finish their duel did the fighting within the city die down, though it has yet to subside completely.

Dalkeith, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]]: Left barren by nuclear and chemical weapons in the First Succession War, Dalkeith has served as a training ground and staging post for raids against the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]] and Clan territories for years. Hosting a significant stockpile of consumables and materiel as well as extensive repair and refit facilities, Dalkeith represents a significant strategic asset for whatever faction can hold it. Stationed there before the outset of the FedCom Civil War, the Fourth Deneb Light Cavalry had stubbornly refused to declare for either side, hoping to serve as a deterrent force for any 3rd parties attempting to exploit the conflict. Unfortunately for the Fourth DLC, ""armed neutrality"" was not good enough for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], and the Thirteenth Donegal Guard were deployed to Dalkeith to occupy the facilities and forcibly relieve the Fourth DLC. When the Fourth refused and shots were fired, the Civil War truly arrived on Dalkeith as the Fourth DLC openly declared for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]].

In a surprising turn of events, once Prince Victor took custody of his sister, he renounced all claims to the thrones on either New Avalon or [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTharkad],Tharkad]].  Victor instead recognized his brother Peter as Archon of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]], while Princess Yvonne again assumed the mantle of Princess-Regent for her yet-unborn child.

In one of Princess-Regent's first actions, she officially renamed the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]] back to the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]].  The new leaders of both nations have pledge to heal the wounds of the Civil War and to focus their energies on reconstruction efforts-both within their cities and their militaries.  With the Truce of Tukayyid set to expire later this month, and the Fourth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreWhittingCon],Whitting Conference]] scheduled to begin in November, many observers are waiting to see what the next era brings forth.",

In what was clearly a carefully coordinated move, a motley collection of mercenary forces headed by elements of Waco’s Rangers and Smithson’s Chinese Bandits came boiling out of TempTown, overrunning Harlech's prison and the ‘Mech holding pens. Meanwhile, the Tiger Sharks—a mercenary battalion returning from night exercises on the practice fields-made a drive for Harlech's DropPort.

He admits to no stated origin, only referencing his home as 'the Sixth House' and saying he was betrayed by those he once called his allies and so was driven out into the cold, cold stars. His skills in the cockpit are excellent and he follows orders without question though there is always a feeling that he is silently judging and making his own secret plans. He has no reputation from other mercenary companies as no one claims to have previously hired him. It is as though he simply appeared in the hiring hall with no history one day. However, if you really ask around, there's rumors that he has some dark sorcery that chases him across the stars and that he is fleeing from. Oh, and don't ask why he names every mech he drives Akulakhan, you won't get an answer.

After years of training on Terra, he then continued to serve the Blessed Blake as a HPG technician on a fairly backwater world in the Taurian Concordat know as Argos (as happens with new acolytes, they have to learn somewhere).  For several years he labored at his duties without much distinction or notice.

Near the close of the 3rd Succession War, the HPG station was attacked by a group of extremely bold (if not more than a little stupid) pirates.  ComStar put out a call to the local militia while their meager security force held the pirates at bay as best as they could.  However, the pirates soon overwhelmed the ComStar base, and several pirates exited their vehicles to begin looting the compound.  It was at this moment that Adam's life took a turn.  Making a rash decision to do whatever it took to protect the blessed HPG and technology of old, Adam climbed into a vacated 'Mech and powered it up.  Despite a lack of actual training, he found that the controls matched the simulation pods that he enjoyed playing with in his off hours.  With his purloined 'Mech lurching into motion he managed some lucky shots, destroying a pirate APC Transport and crippling two tanks.  He even managed to knock over one of their Stinger Light 'Mechs as he careened off the side in an ungainly attempt at a charge.  Between this unexpected resistance, and the sudden appearance of the local militia, the tide was turned and the pirates were soon in full retreat.

With the battle over, the Precentor in charge of the HPG noted Adam's deeds and encouraged him to walk the missionary's path, believing that Blessed Blake had a higher purpose in mind for him.  Adam was to learn the way of the MechWarrior, while also spreading the Word of Blake amongst the stars and searching out other like minded warriors of faith.  Calling in some old favors, the Precentor sponsored Adam and had him sent to a Concordat training academy.  Wishing him well, the Precentor gifted Adam with a rare printed copy of Jerome Blake's writings, to help guide him through this new future and keep him on the path - this was to become one of Adam's most cherished of possessions over the following years.

Adam now travels the stars, preaching the good word of Blake and fighting for good causes that champion the little folk who so often get forgotten by the larger powers, but not the little mercenaries.

Several large mercenary formations, ostensibly hired by the Acamar Merchants Freedom Guild (AMFG), have landed on that embattled planet. The size of the invading mercenaries appear larger than what many believed the AMFG were able to hire, leading to speculation that there are far more powerful backers behind the merchants.

In a well-timed move, another large contingent of mercenaries are heading to the planet Genoa.  Combat on that planet, wracked by infighting among various corporate CEOs, has been dominated by infantry fighting in tunnels beneath the planet's surface.  The arrival of these Battlemech-equipped mercenaries will undoubtedly change the dimensions of the conflict on Genoa.

In a prepared statement, the ruling Council of Merchants has roundly condemned the Clan aggression against their neighbors, saying that the Hanseatic League will not stand for such blatant aggression in their region of space. [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanGoliathScorpion],Clan Goliath Scorpion]] has responded by saying that their intelligence indicates that the Hanseatic League fed the Castilian internal conflict for decades by selling weapons to both sides and thus should mind their own business, lest the Goliath Scorpions decide to take action to protect the new [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEscorpionImperio],Escorpión Imperio]].
